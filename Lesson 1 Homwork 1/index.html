In Homer and Lisa Crosswords, she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called the Lil' Lisa on her parents' first anniversary. This is a charismatic 8-year-old girl who exceeds the standard achievements of the level of intelligence of children of her age. To everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. Lisa's upbringing lacks the parental involvement of Homer and Marge, leading to hobbies such as playing the saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and an interest in advanced studies. At school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who see her as a nerd who doesn't keep up, leaving her with few friends. She is focused on her goals and eager to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159.
